# Ansible k8s bootstrap via kubeadm tool 

Ansible playbook to bootstrap production-ready K8s cluster with some required addons on a vSphere/vCloud platform
Intended to call from this Terraform module: https://github.com/werton13/k8s-kubeadm-ansible
this playbook is still in construction and often updating.

To do:
1. add HAproxy LB
2. add certmanager
3. add audit configuration
4. add RBAC + gatekeeper

I have a lot to add, so this list will also be updated.
